  FemboyAccess is a remote administration trojan that uses Discord as a C2C server.
</p>

## Purpose

FemboyAccess is a RAT (Remote Administration Tool/Trojan) that uses the Discord platform as a C2C (command & control) server. More specifically, it uses your own custom Discord guild and then uses a bot account to send commands from the server to the victim's computer.

## Features

- almost undetectable
- escalate privileges without UAC
- can handle multiple machines at once
- a lot of commands
- silent

FemboyAccess 1.6 and higher contains a stealth mode activated by default (line `126` to change that) that hides the Python window and changes the process name. Reminder that you can create pull requests, so if you have any ideas to hide FemboyAccess even more, give it a shot!

## Usage

  1. Download Python with all the necessary requirements and the repository to your computer.
  2. [Create a Discord bot](https://discord.dev/) (make sure to check all intents on) then invite it on a new server.
  3. Open `builder.py` and enter what's requested (server ID and bot token).
  4. Finished! Now, you can obfuscate it yourself if you want to. Whenever someone will open the file, a new channel will be created in your defined server with a custom session ID. Type `help` to see a list of all available commands.

Note: FemboyAccess treats all machines like sessions and attributes them a 8-character long ID with letters and numbers. That's how the bot can manage multiple machines at the same time. The format of the generated channel name is something like:

`<computer_name>-<session_id>`

So if the computer's name is 'ambr0sial', the channel name will be something like:

`ambr0sial-6ef87f83`
